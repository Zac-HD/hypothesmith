# hypothesmith
Hypothesis strategies for generating Python programs, something like CSmith.

This is definitely pre-alpha, but if you want to play with it feel free!
You can even keep the shiny pieces when - not if - it breaks.

Get it today with `pip install hypothesmith`, or by cloning the GitHub repo.
You can run the tests, such as they are, with `tox` on Python 3.6 or later.
